2A3D File Manager

Will properly fill this out at a later time for now some to-dos:

-Add results to search (in progress)

-Database Comparison with identifiers I'd a file is new or dev has new files

-code refactor/organization (highly needed) lots of dead or redundant code

-Search folder for existing files. could be done as long as the existing file name matches the one listed in the database. these files and their path would be downloaded.db optionally they could be moved from their existing location into the folder structure maintained by the program. 

-Gui style unification. many popups use differing styles of popups

- Lite version running on a browser could replace the installed version ensuring cross platform compatability. user would have to download the correct lbrynet.exe or we include all three add OS detection...or something idk
